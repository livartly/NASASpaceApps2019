Plan-It is a game that allows the player to create their own solar system with unique and intriguing planets. Our aim is to spark interest in astrophysics by providing an easy and enjoyable introduction to space study.

## About Us

We are Team StarStruck, a group of four college friends studying computer science with backgrounds in art, game development, and astrophysics. In creating Plan-It, we endeavored to make astrophysics—an inherently complex, yet captivating field—accessible and fun.

## What It Does

Plan-It is a sandbox game intended to educate its users on various astrophysical concepts, including the life cycle of stars, the composition of gas planets, and differing atmospheres of rocky planets. This game is aimed at individuals curious about space but unsure where to start.

Users begin by focusing on a star at the center of a large solar system. The menu surrounding the star displays its characteristics and allows the user to modify its properties. We also provide links for users to learn more about the star. Similarly, users can explore planets and their properties.
